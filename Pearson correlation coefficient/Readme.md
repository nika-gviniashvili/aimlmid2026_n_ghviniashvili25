The blue data points were taken from the interactive graph at
max.ge/aiml_midterm/15289_html.

Each data point’s (x,y)(x, y)(x,y) coordinates were obtained by hovering the mouse over the graph and then manually written in the python code by myself.
After collecting the data, the Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated using Python. The recorded x and y values were stored in NumPy arrays, and the numpy.corrcoef() function was used to compute the correlation coefficient r - 0.9497856904029837. this number indicates a very strong positive linear relationship between the variables. This means that as the values of x increase, the values of y also increase in a nearly linear manner. In addition for the visualization code generates png file of the graph.
